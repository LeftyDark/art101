    	<h1>Lab 7- Functions</h1>
    	<h2>By Ryan McCarty and Darren Yang</h2>
    	<div>Challenge
    		<p>Our challenge for this lab was to create a Javascript function that would take a name inputted by the person visiting the website and then sort it.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div>Problems
    		<p>One problem we faced for a moment was that this index was not linking to the code, but then we realized it was linking lab.js when the file was titled lab7.js. We also just had to do some bugfixing on the js code and the sorting function until it worked and its output appeared how we wanted it to.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div>Results
    		<p>As you should have seen while opening the website it asked for name input, and the sorted name that is the result of that function is below.</p>
    		<div>
          <h2>Script Output</h2>
          <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
