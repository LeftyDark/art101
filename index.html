			<h1>Ryan McCarty</h1>
			<p>This is the homepage for Ryan McCarty's work in his ART 101 class. Ryan is a Junior Art and Design: Games and Playable Media Major from San Jose, California. He likes video games (mainly RPGs), writing, theater, anime, and plenty of other things. He spends more time than he'd like each day waiting in the Porter Dining Hall Line, but that is a sacrifice that must be made to eat at the only dining hall near Rachel Carson.</p>

			<p>He is interested in the kinds of art this class focuses on, and is looking forward to learning more and creating some of his own!</p>
