	<h1>Lab 4- Psuedocode and Problem-Solving</h1>
	<h2>By Ryan McCarty and Darren Yang</h2>

	</div>
	<div>Challenge
		<p>Our challenge in this assignment was to psuedocode both an everyday task and a computer focused task, then place that Psuedocode in both a Javascript file and this index.html.</p>
	</div>
	<div>Problems
		<p>Some problems we faced were was trying to get to work with eachother over Teletype, specifically trying to make sure we could access all files. Although I could let my partner access and edit the lab.js file, I was unable to get them access to the index.html file, so I had to focus on it myself and copy their javascript code in.</p>
	</div>
	<div>Results
		<p>Here is our psuedocode in a readable way on this html file, which is the product of this lab.</p>
