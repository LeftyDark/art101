    	<h1>Lab 12- Conditionals</h1>
    	<h2>By Ryan McCarty and Darren Yang</h2>
    	<div>Challenge
    		<p>Our challenge for this lab was to create a function that uses conditionals such as if, else, and elseif statements to sort an input into .</p>
    	</div>
    	<div>Problems
    		<p>Some problems we faced were accidentally missing a ) at the end of the click function in my javaScript code which made it break for a long time until we realized that was the problem.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div>Results
        <p>Here is the sorting function that uses if and else if statements.</p>
        <div>
        Please enter your name so we can sort it into a Hogwarts house:
        <input type="text" id="input">
        <button id="button">Submit</button>
        <p id="output">Your house is not decided yet.</p>
        <img id="hogwarts" src="img/houses.jpg" />
        </div>
